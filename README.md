# Intelligent-Intersection
The SUMO simulation platform is used to realize the traditional traffic lights, intelligent traffic lights and intelligent traffic intersections.

## Simulation 1: Same traffic density on each lane
Vehicles are generated every 6 seconds with probability of 0.3 at the starting point of each lane.
